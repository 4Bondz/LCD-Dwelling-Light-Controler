# LCD-Dwelling-Light-Controler (LCD-DLC)
This code uses three buttons connected to an Arduino to control transisors connected to standard lights and LEDs.
All of the functions are displayed through a user-friendly LCD display.
This program also comes with a handy timer that allows a user to turn lights on or off after a set duration.
The Library (LiquidCrystal) used is built into the Arduino software but can be found at www.arduino.cc.
For this particular project, I am using three buttons as inputs and a 20X4 LCD as the visual output.
This code can be adapted to fit a 16X2 LCD but is best used with a 20x4 LCD screen.
